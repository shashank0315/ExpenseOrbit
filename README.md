## 🧪 Test Steps to Validate

Test the application using these sample steps:

1. **Log an Expense**
   - Choose Option 1
   - Enter: `2025-04-10`
   - Category: `Food`
   - Amount: `200`

2. **Set a Monthly Budget**
   - Choose Option 2
   - Category: `Food`
   - Budget: `500`

3. **Trigger Budget Alert**
   - Add another `Food` expense of `400`
   - Expect: ⚠ Budget exceeded message

4. **Generate Monthly Report**
   - Choose Option 3
   - Enter Month: `2025-04`
   - Expect: Total + per-category breakdown + budget comparison

## 🧾 SQL/ORM Implementation

Currently, this is an in-memory CLI app. For ORM support, we plan to integrate **SQLite** using **SQLAlchemy** for persistent storage.

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup (To be implemented)

A Dockerfile will be added for containerized deployment.

**Planned steps:**
```bash
docker build -t expense-orbit .
docker run -it expense-orbit
```

Let me know if you’d like help:
- Adding SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Writing Dockerfile and `.dockerignore`
- Implementing any extra credit features

Would you also like a `.gitignore` and a minimal `requirements.txt` file?
